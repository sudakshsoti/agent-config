# pi-token-speed

A [Pi Coding Agent](https://pi.dev/) extension that displays real-time **tokens-per-second (TPS)** performance metrics in the status bar while the AI is streaming responses.

## Features

- **Real-time TPS tracking** — measures token throughput as the assistant generates text and thinking content
- **Time-to-first-token (TTFT)** — measures latency from user message to the first token being generated
- **Configurable sliding window** — adjust the window size to suit your server speed (default: 1s)
- **Color-coded speed indicators** — visual feedback based on performance thresholds
- **Configurable update interval** — throttle status bar updates to reduce visual flickering
- **Provider-reported counting** — opt in to using provider-reported counts (e.g. Anthropic, OpenAI) instead of the extension's own counter
- **Fully configurable** — customize display, thresholds and colors via `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`

## Speed Tiers

| Tier       | TPS   | Color              |
| ---------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| 🟥 Slow    | 0–15  | `#ff4444` (red)    |
| 🟨 Medium  | 15–30 | `#ffaa00` (orange) |
| 🟩 Fast    | 30–45 | `#00ff88` (green)  |
| 🟦 Blazing | 45+   | `#44ddff` (cyan)   |

## Installation

This package is a Pi extension. Install it with

```bash
npm install pi-token-speed
```

or

```bash
pi install https://github.com/gsanhueza/pi-token-speed
```

## Configuration

You can customize the display, speed thresholds and colors by adding a `tokenSpeed` section to your `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "tokenSpeed": {
    "tpsSlow": 0,
    "tpsMedium": 15,
    "tpsFast": 30,
    "tpsBlazing": 45,
    "colorSlow": "#ff4444",
    "colorMedium": "#ffaa00",
    "colorFast": "#00ff88",
    "colorBlazing": "#44ddff",
    "display": "tps",
    "useProviderTokens": false,
    "countStrategy": "direct",
    "endTpsBehavior": "average",
    "icon": "⚡",
    "slidingWindow": 1000,
    "updateInterval": 0
  }
}
```

### Configuration Validation

Invalid configuration values are automatically corrected to their defaults. A warning notification is displayed in the Pi status bar at session start listing any corrections made. The `slidingWindow` value is also clamped between `100ms` and `30000ms` (30s).

### Interactive Menu

A small interactive menu is available when running `/tps` in the editor, where you can adjust:

- **Display mode** — what to show in the status bar
- **Status icon** — choose the icon shown before TPS (`⚡`, `🔥`, `💨`, `🚀`, or none)
- **Status update interval** — throttle status bar updates (see [Status Update Interval](#status-update-interval))
- **Use provider tokens** — use provider-reported counts instead of the extension's counter
- **Count strategy** — how the extension counts tokens (`estimate` or `direct`)
- **Sliding window** — time window for TPS calculation (see [Sliding Window](#sliding-window))
- **End-of-stream TPS** — what to show after streaming ends (`average` or `last`)
- **Thresholds** — customize the TPS threshold values for each tier (see [Threshold Customization](#threshold-customization))
- **Colors** — customize the hex color for each TPS tier (see [Color Customization](#color-customization))

### Sliding Window

The sliding window determines how many recent tokens are used to calculate TPS. A larger window produces smoother readings at the cost of responsiveness; a smaller window reacts faster but can be noisier. To avoid burst spikes, the time span used in the calculation is clamped to a minimum threshold of 100ms.

#### Burst & Stall Handling

When a provider buffers output and flushes it all at once, all tokens arrive with the same timestamp. In this case, the TPS calculation extends the time span backward to include the gap since the last token, giving a more representative reading:

```
20 tokens → 5s stall → 500 tokens flushed
```

Without this handling, TPS would show `5000 tok/s` (500 tokens / 100ms clamp). With it, the reading reflects the actual throughput including the stall period (~100 tok/s).

A legitimate burst spread over time (different timestamps) is not affected — the span uses the actual time between the first and last token in the window.

| Server speed        | Recommended window | Why                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fast (30+ tok/s)    | `1000` (default)   | Plenty of tokens in the window — accurate and responsive  |
| Medium (5–30 tok/s) | `1000`–`3000`      | Enough tokens for stable readings                         |
| Slow (< 5 tok/s)    | `5000`–`15000`     | Captures more tokens, avoiding spiky or unreliable values |

For example, if your server streams at ~1 tok/s, a 10-second window gives ~10 tokens per window — enough for a reasonable calculation:

```json
{
  "tokenSpeed": {
    "slidingWindow": 10000
  }
}
```

### Provider Token Counts

By default, this extension uses its own token counter — the same engine behind `countStrategy`. As an alternative, you can opt in to using the provider's own reported counts instead:

| Value             | Behavior                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `false` (default) | Use this extension's own counter (controlled by `countStrategy`)                            |
| `true`            | Use the provider's reported counts instead; fall back to `countStrategy` when not available |

The extension's own counter is the default and always available. Enable `useProviderTokens: true` when your provider reports accurate token counts and you'd prefer to use them instead.

### Count Strategy

When `useProviderTokens` is `false` (default) or when the provider doesn't report counts, the `countStrategy` determines how the extension's own counter works:

| Strategy           | Behavior                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `direct` (default) | Counts each delta as 1 token        |
| `estimate`         | Approximates tokens from delta text |

The `direct` strategy is fast and preserves the original behavior — it counts each streaming delta as 1 token, including toolcalls for `edit` and `write` operations. Use `estimate` when your server streams in small chunks — it approximates the real token count from the delta text, giving a more meaningful TPS reading.

> **Note:** Only `edit` and `write` tool call deltas are counted. Other tool calls (prompt processing) are excluded from token counting.

### Timer Pausing

The extension automatically pauses the TPS timer when a prompt processing tool call ends (any tool other than `edit` or `write`). This prevents tool processing time from skewing the TPS calculation. The timer resumes when the next token delta arrives.

### End-of-Stream TPS Behavior

After streaming ends, the `endTpsBehavior` option controls what TPS value is displayed:

| Behavior            | Behavior                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `average` (default) | Returns the overall average TPS (`total tokens / total elapsed seconds`). Consistent with the stats display.                                      |
| `last`              | Returns the last sliding window TPS measurement from the moment streaming stopped. Useful for seeing how fast the model was streaming at the end. |

This is also configurable via the `/tps` interactive menu.

### Color Customization

The four TPS tier colors can be customized via the `/tps` interactive menu by selecting **Colors**. Each tier opens a hex color input where you can enter a custom `#RRGGBB` value.

Alternatively, you can set colors directly in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "tokenSpeed": {
    "colorSlow": "#cc3333",
    "colorMedium": "#cc8800",
    "colorFast": "#00cc66",
    "colorBlazing": "#33bbdd"
  }
}
```

### Threshold Customization

The four TPS tier thresholds can be customized via the `/tps` interactive menu by selecting **Thresholds**. Each tier opens a numeric input where you can enter a non-negative integer value. Thresholds must be in strict ascending order (`tpsSlow < tpsMedium < tpsFast < tpsBlazing`); invalid values are rejected with a warning.

Alternatively, you can set thresholds directly in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "tokenSpeed": {
    "tpsSlow": 0,
    "tpsMedium": 20,
    "tpsFast": 40,
    "tpsBlazing": 60
  }
}
```

### Status Update Interval

By default, the status bar updates on every token delta. If you're experiencing visual flickering, you can configure the update interval in milliseconds via the `/tps` interactive menu (`0`, `50`, `100`, `200`, `500`).

You can also set a custom value in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "tokenSpeed": {
    "updateInterval": 80
  }
}
```

The TPS calculation continues normally regardless of the update interval — only the status bar rendering is throttled.

## Display Modes

| Mode    | Description                                                                 |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tps`   | `⚡ TPS: 25.0 tok/s` — TPS with color-coded speed tier                      |
| `ttft`  | `⚡ TPS: 25.0 tok/s (TTFT: 450 ms)` — TPS + time-to-first-token             |
| `stats` | `⚡ TPS: 25.0 tok/s (150 tok in 6.0s)` — TPS + token count and elapsed time |
| `full`  | `⚡ TPS: 25.0 tok/s (150 tok in 6.0s · TTFT: 450 ms)` — everything          |

> **Note:** Set `icon: ""` to hide the icon prefix, rendering just `TPS: 25.0 tok/s`.

### Example: Minimal status bar

With `icon: ""` and `display: "tps"`, the status bar shows:

```
TPS: 25.0 tok/s
```

### Custom icons

The `/tps` command offers `⚡`, `🔥`, `💨`, `🚀` and none. You can also set any custom icon directly in your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "tokenSpeed": {
    "icon": "🎯"
  }
}
```

## Commands

| Command | Description                                                                                   |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/tps`  | Open settings menu to configure available options (see [Interactive Menu](#interactive-menu)) |

## How It Works

1. **Session Start** — Renders the initial status bar entry showing the configured icon followed by `TPS: --`
2. **Message Start** — When a user message starts, TTFT measurement begins
3. **First Token & Streaming Start** — The moment the first content block starts (`text_start`, `thinking_start`, or `toolcall_start`), the TTFT is recorded and the streaming engine starts tracking
4. **Token Update** — Each text/thinking delta is recorded. If `useProviderTokens` is `true` and the provider reports token counts, those are used directly; otherwise the extension's own counter (controlled by `countStrategy`) is used
5. **Sliding Window** — TPS is calculated using a configurable time window of token timestamps. If all events in the window share the same timestamp (a flush after a stall), the span extends backward to include the gap. When streaming ends, behavior depends on `endTpsBehavior`:
   - `average` (default): returns the overall average TPS for consistency with stats.
   - `last`: returns the last sliding window measurement.
6. **Agent End** — The authoritative token count (if available) is used to snap the total, ensuring the final average is exact. Streaming is stopped.
